## Milestone 3 Submission - Containerization


# Setting Up the Project

## Prerequisites

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Docker installed.
3. (Optional) Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account
   - The docker compose file is configured to use a local MongoDB instance by default. If you would like to use a remote MongoDB instance, you can follow the instructions in the ["Remote DB Setup"](#remote-db-setup-mongodb-atlas-optional) section below.


## Spinning Up Docker Containers

### Docker Compose for all services (including frontend)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, you can modify the values in the .env file
      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      | NEXT_PUBLIC_QUESTION_SERVICE_URL | URL of the question service | http://localhost:8003 |
      | NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_UPLOAD_KEY | AuthToken for image upload | None, you can get this from https://www.portive.com |
      | FRONTEND_PORT | Port to run the frontend service | 3000 |
      | USER_MONGODB_URI | MongoDB URI for the user service | None, commented out. If you are using a remote MongoDB instance, you can key in your connection string here |
      | USER_MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME | MongoDB root username for the user service | userroot |
      | USER_MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD | MongoDB root password for the user service | userpassword |
      | USER_PORT | Port to run the user service | 8004 |
      | JWT_SECRET | Secret for creating JWT signature | you-can-replace-this-with-your-own-secret |
      | QUESTION_MONGODB_URI | MongoDB URI for the question service | None, commented out. If you are using a remote MongoDB instance, you can key in your connection string here |
      | QUESTION_MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME | MongoDB root username for the question service | questionroot |
      | QUESTION_MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD | MongoDB root password for the question service | questionpassword |
      | QUESTION_PORT | Port to run the question service | 8003 |
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the services.
   - If you keyed in remote MongoDB URIs in the .env file, the MongoDB containers will not be started. The services will connect to the remote MongoDB instances instead.
4. Once the services are up and running, you can access the frontend at `http://localhost:<FRONTEND_PORT>` (default: <http://localhost:3000>)

### Docker Compose for individual services

If the services are to be run individually (e.g. for deployment on different platforms), you can follow the instructions below.

#### Question Service

1. cd into the question-service directory
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, you can modify the values in the .env file

      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      |QUESTION_MONGODB_URI  | MongoDB URI     | None, commented out. If you are using a remote MongoDB instance, you can key in your connection string here |
      | QUESTION_PORT         | Port to run the service | 8003 |
      | MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME | MongoDB root username | root |
      | MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD | MongoDB root password | password |

3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the question service.
   - If you keyed in a remote MongoDB URI in the .env file, the MongoDB container will not be started. The question service will connect to the remote MongoDB instance instead.

##### Common Issue and Troubleshooting
Issue: MongoParseError: URI malformed
- Solution: Ensure that the MONGODB_URI in your .env file is correctly formatted with the right username, password, and database name.

##### Question Service API Endpoints

You can now test the API endpoints using Postman or any API testing tool. By default, the server should be running on <http://localhost:8003/>

The question service API can be found here: [Question Service API](./question-service/README.md)

#### User Service

1. cd into the user-service directory
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, modify the values in the .env file to change the port that the service is hosted on.

      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      | USER_MONGODB_URI  | MongoDB URI     | None, commented out. If you are using a remote MongoDB instance, you can key in your connection string here|
      | MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME | MongoDB root username | root |
      | MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD | MongoDB root password | password |
      | USER_PORT         | Port to run the service | 8004 |
      | JWT_SECRET | Secret for creating JWT signature | you-can-replace-this-with-your-own-secret |
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the user service.
   - If you keyed in a remote MongoDB URI in the .env file, the MongoDB container will not be started. The user service will connect to the remote MongoDB instance instead.

##### User Service API Endpoints

You can now test the API endpoints using Postman or any API testing tool. By default, the server should be running on <http://localhost:8004/>

The user service API can be found here: [User Service API](./user-service/README.md)

#### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend/peerprep
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, you can modify the values in the .env file

      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      | NEXT_PUBLIC_QUESTION_SERVICE_URL | URL of the question service | http://localhost:8003 |
      | NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_UPLOAD_KEY | AuthToken for image upload | None, you can get this from https://www.portive.com |
      | FRONTEND_PORT | Port to run the frontend service | 3000 |
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the frontend service.

## Remote DB Setup (MongoDB Atlas) (Optional)

1. Visit the MongoDB Atlas Site [https://www.mongodb.com/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) and click on "Try Free"

2. Sign Up/Sign In with your preferred method.

3. You will be greeted with welcome screens. Feel free to skip them till you reach the Dashboard page.

4. Create a Database Deployment by clicking on the green `+ Create` Button:

- Leave `Additional Settings` as it is

- Provide a suitable name to the Cluster

6. You will be prompted to set up Security for the database by providing `Username and Password`. Select that option and enter `Username` and `Password`. Please keep this safe as it will be used in User Service later on.

![alt text](./GuideAssets/Security.png)

7. Next, click on `Add my Current IP Address`. This will whiteliste your IP address and allow you to connect to the MongoDB Database.

![alt text](./GuideAssets/Network.png)

8. Click `Finish and Close` and the MongoDB Instance should be up and running.

9. The connection string can be found by clicking on the `Connect` button on the Cluster Overview Page. followed by `Drivers`.
